Hi, im Thabb or Lukas if you will.

Im a student of computerscience in Leipzig, Germany and im spending a larger portion of my freetime to dabble in some minor game development. Thats what you might see on my Github page.

Beyond that my interests lie more in backend then frontend work. Also im interested in working on and studying technology that might change this world for the better in the future. So everything related to the future of energy management, VR and other stuff in that area.

Im quite fluent in Java and C# and somewhat capable of managing in JavaScript and Python, but im not a huge fan of the latter. Also the Unity engine lies in my field of expertise.

Not sure if anyone even reads this Github pages, but if you happen to do so, you are free to contact me with anything you like. I might even answer!
